# 1.0 Introduction

Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) are becoming increasingly popular in the cryptocurrency space as they allow for a community-driven decision-making process. However, one of the major challenges DAOs face is engaging community members to actively participate in the decision-making process. This proposal aims to address this challenge by proposing a gamification framework that enhances community engagement in DAOs using DAO Manager.
DAOs (Decentralized Autonomous Organizations) have gained immense popularity in recent years. These organizations operate on the blockchain and provide a decentralized way of managing funds, decision-making, and other activities. However, community engagement is crucial for the success of DAOs. In order to promote community engagement, we propose a gamification framework that will be integrated with DAO Manager. This framework will motivate users to participate in DAO activities and encourage collaboration among community members. DAOs or Decentralized Autonomous Organizations have become increasingly popular as a way to manage decentralized communities and projects. However, community engagement and participation can often be a challenge. This proposal outlines a gamification framework that can enhance community engagement in DAOs, using DAO Manager, a platform for managing and organizing DAOs.
Gamification Framework Overview:
The gamification framework will be designed to incentivize and reward community participation and engagement in DAO activities. This will be achieved through a points-based system, where users can earn points for different types of participation. These points can then be redeemed for rewards or used to unlock additional features and benefits within the DAO.
Types of Participation: The following are some examples of the types of participation that can be rewarded within the gamification framework:

1. Contributing to discussions on the DAO forum or chat.
2. Participating in DAO governance, such as voting on proposals.
3. Contributing to the development of the DAO's project or platform.
4. Promoting the DAO on social media or other platforms.
   Rewards: Rewards will be designed to incentivize and motivate users to participate in DAO activities. These rewards could include:
5. Access to exclusive content or features within the DAO platform.
6. Discounts or other benefits when using the DAO's products or services.
7. A stake in the DAO's tokens or governance tokens.
8. Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) that represent achievements or milestones within the DAO.
   Gamification Framework Architecture: The gamification framework will be built using smart contracts on a blockchain platform, such as Ethereum. DAO Manager will be integrated with the smart contracts to enable the tracking and management of user participation and rewards. The smart contracts will also enable the automatic distribution of rewards to users.
   Gamification Framework Implementation: A working prototype of the gamification framework will be developed and integrated with DAO Manager. The prototype will be tested and refined to ensure its functionality and effectiveness in motivating users to participate in DAO activities.

# 2.0 Gamification Framework

The proposed gamification framework is designed to work with DAO Manager and is flexible enough to work with various types of DAOs. The gamification framework consists of four main components:

1. Points System: A point system is implemented to reward community members for their contributions to the DAO. Points are awarded for various activities such as voting, proposing new ideas, participating in discussions, and recruiting new members.
2. Leaderboards: A leaderboard displays the points earned by community members in real-time, encouraging healthy competition among members. This encourages members to be more active and contribute more to the DAO.
3. Achievements: Achievements are unlocked as members earn points for their contributions. Achievements can include badges, titles, and other rewards that recognize the member's contribution to the DAO.
4. Rewards System: A rewards system is implemented to incentivize community members to participate in DAO activities. Rewards can include tokens, access to exclusive events, and other benefits.

# 3.0 Technical Details

The gamification framework is built on top of DAO Manager and utilizes its APIs to interact with the DAO. The gamification framework is designed as a separate module that can be added to any DAO that uses DAO Manager. The framework is built using modern web development technologies such as React, Node.js, and MongoDB. The framework is designed to be scalable to accommodate growth in membership and activities.

## 3.1 Prototype

A working prototype of the gamification framework has been developed and is available for testing. The prototype demonstrates the functionality and effectiveness of the gamification framework in motivating users to participate in DAO activities.

## 3.2 Timeline and Budget

The development of the gamification framework is estimated to take six months. The budget for the development of the gamification framework is $450,000. This budget includes the cost of development, testing, and deployment of the framework.

## 3.4 Evaluation

The effectiveness of the gamification framework in promoting community engagement in DAOs will be evaluated using various metrics such as the number of new members recruited, the number of proposals submitted, the number of votes cast, and the number of discussions initiated. The evaluation will be conducted over a period of six months, during which the gamification framework will be in use.

## 4.0 Framework Design:

The gamification framework will be designed to work with DAO Manager. It will consist of the following components:

1. Point System: A point system will be implemented that will reward users for participating in DAO activities. Points will be awarded for tasks such as voting, making proposals, and contributing to discussions.
1. Levels: Users will be assigned different levels based on the number of points they earn. Higher levels will provide users with more privileges, such as the ability to make proposals and vote on more important decisions.
1. Leaderboard: A leaderboard will be implemented that will display the top users based on their points. This will encourage users to compete with each other and strive to earn more points.
1. Badges: Users will be awarded badges for completing specific tasks, such as making successful proposals or contributing to discussions on a regular basis.
1. Rewards: Users will be rewarded with tokens or other incentives for reaching certain milestones, such as reaching a certain level or earning a certain number of points.

# 5.0 Technical Details:

The gamification framework will be built on top of DAO Manager using smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. The framework will be implemented using the following technologies:

1. Solidity: The smart contracts that will be used to implement the point system, levels, and rewards will be written in Solidity.
1. Ethers.js: The Ethers.js library will be used to interact with the Ethereum blockchain.
1. React: The frontend of the gamification framework will be built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
1. IPFS: The Inter-Planetary File System (IPFS) will be used to store data such as user profiles, badges, and rewards.

# 6.0 Evaluation:

Evaluation of Effectiveness: A report will be produced that evaluates the effectiveness of the gamification framework in promoting community engagement in DAOs. This report will include data on user participation and engagement, as well as user feedback on the effectiveness and usability of the gamification framework. The report will also include recommendations for further improvements and enhancements to the framework.
The effectiveness of the gamification framework in promoting community engagement will be evaluated by measuring the following metrics:

1. User Engagement: The number of users participating in DAO activities will be tracked before and after the implementation of the gamification framework.
1. User Retention: The percentage of users who continue to participate in DAO activities over time will be measured.
